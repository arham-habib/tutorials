Notice to any joint holder constitutes notice to all joint holders. Each joint account holder is jointly and severally liable to IBKR for all account matters. IBKR may follow instructions of any joint holder and make delivery of any account property to any joint account holder individually. Upon the death of any joint holder, the surviving holder shall provide immediate written Notice to IBKR and IBKR may, before or after receipt of Notice, initiate proceedings, require documents, retain or liquidate assets or restrict transactions as it deems advisable in its sole discretion to protect itself against any liability or loss. The estate of any deceased joint account holder and each surviving joint account holder will be liable, jointly and severally, to IBKR for any debt or loss in the account or upon liquidation of the account. Unless Clients indicate otherwise, IBKR may presume that joint account holders are joint tenants with rights of survivorship, and upon the death of any such joint tenant, the account shall be vested in the surviving holders, without in any manner releasing the deceased joint tenant\\'s estate from liability.14.Custodial Accounts: If an account is opened under either the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act or the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UGMA or UTMA), the custodian of the account represents that all assets in the account belong to the beneficiary and that the custodian will only use the assets for the beneficiary\\'s benefit. The custodian agrees to transfer and deliver to the beneficiary all securities and other property held in the account promptly upon the beneficiary attaining the age specified by the governing state law for termination of the custodianship. In addition, the custodian acknowledges that IBKR may restrict the custodian\\'s access to the account upon termination of the custodianship.15.Margin:A.Risk of Margin Trading: Client understands that margin trading is highly risky and may result in a loss of funds greater than Client has on deposit in the account.
