### TBD
This tutorial is very early on, still unsure what I'll eventually put in here but feel free to checkout the outline

## Prelim Ideas
- Key finding webapp
    - Create a training webapp to figure out the songs key
        - https://inwhatkey.com/song/otherside-by-red-hot-chili-peppers
        - Do it using iframes
    - Add in scale finding
    - Add in score generator?
