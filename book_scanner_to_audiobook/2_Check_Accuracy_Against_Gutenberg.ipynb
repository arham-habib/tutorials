       "OF THE DIVISION OF LABOUR.</h2>\n",
       "<p>\n",
       "The greatest improvements in the productive powers of labour, and the greater\n",
       "part of the skill, dexterity, and judgment, with which it is anywhere directed,\n",
       "or applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labour. The\n",
       "effects of the division of labour, in the general business of society, will be\n",
       "more easily understood, by considering in what manner it operates in some\n",
       "particular manufactures. It is commonly supposed to be carried furthest in some\n",
       "very trifling ones; not perhaps that it really is carried further in them than\n",
       "in others of more importance: but in those trifling manufactures which are\n",
       "destined to supply the small wants of but a small number of people, the whole\n",
       "number of workmen must necessarily be small; and those employed in every\n",
       "different branch of the work can often be collected into the same workhouse,\n",
       "and placed at once under the view of the spectator.\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<p>\n",
       "In those great manufactures, on the contrary, which are destined to supply the\n",
       "great wants of the great body of the people, every different branch of the work\n",
       "employs so great a number of workmen, that it is impossible to collect them all\n",
       "into the same workhouse. We can seldom see more, at one time, than those\n",
       "employed in one single branch. Though in such manufactures, therefore, the work\n",
       "may really be divided into a much greater number of parts, than in those of a\n",
       "more trifling nature, the division is not near so obvious, and has accordingly\n",
       "been much less observed.\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<p>\n",
       "To take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufacture, but one in\n",
       "which the division of labour has been very often taken notice of, the trade of\n",
       "a pin-maker: a workman not educated to this business (which the division of\n",
       "labour has rendered a distinct trade), nor acquainted with the use of the\n",
       "machinery employed in it (to the invention of which the same division of labour\n",
       "has probably given occasion), could scarce, perhaps, with his utmost industry,\n",
       "make one pin in a day, and certainly could not make twenty. But in the way in\n",
       "which this business is now carried on, not only the whole work is a peculiar\n",
       "trade, but it is divided into a number of branches, of which the greater part\n",
       "are likewise peculiar trades. One man draws out the wire; another straights it;\n",
       "a third cuts it; a fourth points it; a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving\n",
       "the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it\n",
       "on is a peculiar business; to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by\n",
       "itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin\n",
       "is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in\n",
       "some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though in others the\n",
       "same man will sometimes perform two or three of them. I have seen a small\n",
       "manufactory of this kind, where ten men only were employed, and where some of\n",
       "them consequently performed two or three distinct operations. But though they\n",
       "were very poor, and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary\n",
       "machinery, they could, when they exerted themselves, make among them about\n",
       "twelve pounds of pins in a day. There are in a pound upwards of four thousand\n",
       "pins of a middling size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them\n",
       "upwards of forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a\n",
       "tenth part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four\n",
       "thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately\n",
       "and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this\n",
       "peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty,\n",
       "perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two hundred and\n",
       "fortieth, perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth, part of what they are\n",
       "at present capable of performing, in consequence of a proper division and\n",
       "combination of their different operations.\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<p>\n",
       "In every other art and manufacture, the effects of the division of labour are\n",
       "similar to what they are in this very trifling one, though, in many of them,\n",
       "the labour can neither be so much subdivided, nor reduced to so great a\n",
       "simplicity of operation. The division of labour, however, so far as it can be\n",
       "introduced, occasions, in every art, a proportionable increase of the\n",
       "productive powers of labour. The separation of different trades and employments\n",
       "from one another, seems to have taken place in consequence of this advantage.\n",
       "This separation, too, is generally carried furthest in those countries which\n",
       "enjoy the highest degree of industry and improvement; what is the work of one\n",
       "man, in a rude state of society, being generally that of several in an improved\n",
       "one. In every improved society, the farmer is generally nothing but a farmer;\n",
       "the manufacturer, nothing but a manufacturer. The labour, too, which is\n",
       "necessary to produce any one complete manufacture, is almost always divided\n",
       "among a great number of hands. How many different trades are employed in each\n",
       "branch of the linen and woollen manufactures, from the growers of the flax and\n",
       "the wool, to the bleachers and smoothers of the linen, or to the dyers and\n",
       "dressers of the cloth! The nature of agriculture, indeed, does not admit of so\n",
       "many subdivisions of labour, nor of so complete a separation of one business\n",
       "from another, as manufactures. It is impossible to separate so entirely the\n",
       "business of the grazier from that of the corn-farmer, as the trade of the\n",
       "carpenter is commonly separated from that of the smith. The spinner is almost\n",
       "always a distinct person from the weaver; but the ploughman, the harrower, the\n",
       "sower of the seed, and the reaper of the corn, are often the same. The\n",
       "occasions for those different sorts of labour returning with the different\n",
       "seasons of the year, it is impossible that one man should be constantly\n",
       "employed in any one of them. This impossibility of making so complete and\n",
       "entire a separation of all the different branches of labour employed in\n",
       "agriculture, is perhaps the reason why the improvement of the productive powers\n",
       "of labour, in this art, does not always keep pace with their improvement in\n",
       "manufactures. The most opulent nations, indeed, generally excel all their\n",
       "neighbours in agriculture as well as in manufactures; but they are commonly\n",
       "more distinguished by their superiority in the latter than in the former. Their\n",
       "lands are in general better cultivated, and having more labour and expense\n",
       "bestowed upon them, produce more in proportion to the extent and natural\n",
       "fertility of the ground. But this superiority of produce is seldom much more\n",
       "than in proportion to the superiority of labour and expense. In agriculture,\n",
       "the labour of the rich country is not always much more productive than that of\n",
       "the poor; or, at least, it is never so much more productive, as it commonly is\n",
       "in manufactures. The corn of the rich country, therefore, will not always, in\n",
       "the same degree of goodness, come cheaper to market than that of the poor. The\n",
       "corn of Poland, in the same degree of goodness, is as cheap as that of France,\n",
       "notwithstanding the superior opulence and improvement of the latter country.\n",
       "The corn of France is, in the corn-provinces, fully as good, and in most years\n",
       "nearly about the same price with the corn of England, though, in opulence and\n",
       "improvement, France is perhaps inferior to England. The corn-lands of England,\n",
       "however, are better cultivated than those of France, and the corn-lands of\n",
       "France are said to be much better cultivated than those of Poland. But though\n",
       "the poor country, notwithstanding the inferiority of its cultivation, can, in\n",
       "some measure, rival the rich in the cheapness and goodness of its corn, it can\n",
       "pretend to no such competition in its manufactures, at least if those\n",
       "manufactures suit the soil, climate, and situation, of the rich country. The\n",
       "silks of France are better and cheaper than those of England, because the silk\n",
       "manufacture, at least under the present high duties upon the importation of raw\n",
       "silk, does not so well suit the climate of England as that of France. But the\n",
       "hardware and the coarse woollens of England are beyond all comparison superior\n",
       "to those of France, and much cheaper, too, in the same degree of goodness. In\n",
       "Poland there are said to be scarce any manufactures of any kind, a few of those\n",
       "coarser household manufactures excepted, without which no country can well\n",
       "subsist.\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<p>\n",
       "This great increase in the quantity of work, which, in consequence of the\n",
       "division of labour, the same number of people are capable of performing, is\n",
       "owing to three different circumstances; first, to the increase of dexterity in\n",
       "every particular workman; secondly, to the saving of the time which is commonly\n",
       "lost in passing from one species of work to another; and, lastly, to the\n",
       "invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labour,\n",
       "and enable one man to do the work of many.\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<p>\n",
       "First, the improvement of the dexterity of the workmen, necessarily increases\n",
       "the quantity of the work he can perform; and the division of labour, by\n",
       "reducing every man’s business to some one simple operation, and by making\n",
       "this operation the sole employment of his life, necessarily increases very much\n",
       "the dexterity of the workman. A common smith, who, though accustomed to handle\n",
       "the hammer, has never been used to make nails, if, upon some particular\n",
       "occasion, he is obliged to attempt it, will scarce, I am assured, be able to\n",
       "make above two or three hundred nails in a day, and those, too, very bad ones.\n",
       "A smith who has been accustomed to make nails, but whose sole or principal\n",
       "business has not been that of a nailer, can seldom, with his utmost diligence,\n",
       "make more than eight hundred or a thousand nails in a day. I have seen several\n",
       "boys, under twenty years of age, who had never exercised any other trade but\n",
       "that of making nails, and who, when they exerted themselves, could make, each\n",
       "of them, upwards of two thousand three hundred nails in a day. The making of a\n",
       "nail, however, is by no means one of the simplest operations. The same person\n",
       "blows the bellows, stirs or mends the fire as there is occasion, heats the\n",
       "iron, and forges every part of the nail: in forging the head, too, he is\n",
       "obliged to change his tools. The different operations into which the making of\n",
       "a pin, or of a metal button, is subdivided, are all of them much more simple,\n",
       "and the dexterity of the person, of whose life it has been the sole business to\n",
       "perform them, is usually much greater. The rapidity with which some of the\n",
       "operations of those manufactures are performed, exceeds what the human hand\n",
       "could, by those who had never seen them, be supposed capable of acquiring.\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<p>\n",
       "Secondly, the advantage which is gained by saving the time commonly lost in\n",
       "passing from one sort of work to another, is much greater than we should at\n",
       "first view be apt to imagine it. It is impossible to pass very quickly from one\n",
       "kind of work to another, that is carried on in a different place, and with\n",
       "quite different tools. A country weaver, who cultivates a small farm, must lose\n",
       "a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field, and from the field\n",
       "to his loom. When the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse, the\n",
       "loss of time is, no doubt, much less. It is, even in this case, however, very\n",
       "considerable. A man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one\n",
       "sort of employment to another. When he first begins the new work, he is seldom\n",
       "very keen and hearty; his mind, as they say, does not go to it, and for some\n",
       "time he rather trifles than applies to good purpose. The habit of sauntering,\n",
       "and of indolent careless application, which is naturally, or rather\n",
       "necessarily, acquired by every country workman who is obliged to change his\n",
       "work and his tools every half hour, and to apply his hand in twenty different\n",
       "ways almost every day of his life, renders him almost always slothful and lazy,\n",
       "and incapable of any vigorous application, even on the most pressing occasions.\n",
       "Independent, therefore, of his deficiency in point of dexterity, this cause\n",
       "alone must always reduce considerably the quantity of work which he is capable\n",
       "of performing.\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<p>\n",
       "Thirdly, and lastly, everybody must be sensible how much labour is facilitated\n",
       "and abridged by the application of proper machinery. It is unnecessary to give\n",
       "any example. I shall only observe, therefore, that the invention of all those\n",
       "machines by which labour is so much facilitated and abridged, seems to have\n",
       "been originally owing to the division of labour. Men are much more likely to\n",
       "discover easier and readier methods of attaining any object, when the whole\n",
       "attention of their minds is directed towards that single object, than when it\n",
       "is dissipated among a great variety of things. But, in consequence of the\n",
       "division of labour, the whole of every man’s attention comes naturally to\n",
       "be directed towards some one very simple object. It is naturally to be\n",
       "expected, therefore, that some one or other of those who are employed in each\n",
       "particular branch of labour should soon find out easier and readier methods of\n",
       "performing their own particular work, whenever the nature of it admits of such\n",
       "improvement. A great part of the machines made use of in those manufactures in\n",
       "which labour is most subdivided, were originally the invention of common\n",
       "workmen, who, being each of them employed in some very simple operation,\n",
       "naturally turned their thoughts towards finding out easier and readier methods\n",
       "of performing it. Whoever has been much accustomed to visit such manufactures,\n",
       "must frequently have been shewn very pretty machines, which were the inventions\n",
       "of such workmen, in order to facilitate and quicken their own particular part\n",
       "of the work. In the first fire engines {this was the current designation for\n",
       "steam engines}, a boy was constantly employed to open and shut alternately the\n",
       "communication between the boiler and the cylinder, according as the piston\n",
       "either ascended or descended. One of those boys, who loved to play with his\n",
       "companions, observed that, by tying a string from the handle of the valve which\n",
       "opened this communication to another part of the machine, the valve would open\n",
       "and shut without his assistance, and leave him at liberty to divert himself\n",
       "with his play-fellows. One of the greatest improvements that has been made upon\n",
       "this machine, since it was first invented, was in this manner the discovery of\n",
       "a boy who wanted to save his own labour.\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<p>\n",
       "All the improvements in machinery, however, have by no means been the\n",
       "inventions of those who had occasion to use the machines. Many improvements\n",
       "have been made by the ingenuity of the makers of the machines, when to make\n",
       "them became the business of a peculiar trade; and some by that of those who are\n",
       "called philosophers, or men of speculation, whose trade it is not to do any\n",
       "thing, but to observe every thing, and who, upon that account, are often\n",
       "capable of combining together the powers of the most distant and dissimilar\n",
       "objects in the progress of society, philosophy or speculation becomes, like\n",
       "every other employment, the principal or sole trade and occupation of a\n",
       "particular class of citizens. Like every other employment, too, it is\n",
       "subdivided into a great number of different branches, each of which affords\n",
       "occupation to a peculiar tribe or class of philosophers; and this subdivision\n",
       "of employment in philosophy, as well as in every other business, improves\n",
       "dexterity, and saves time. Each individual becomes more expert in his own\n",
       "peculiar branch, more work is done upon the whole, and the quantity of science\n",
       "is considerably increased by it.\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<p>\n",
       "It is the great multiplication of the productions of all the different arts, in\n",
       "consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed\n",
       "society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of\n",
       "the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of\n",
       "beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly\n",
       "in the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own\n",
       "goods for a great quantity or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a\n",
       "great quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have\n",
       "occasion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for,\n",
       "and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of the\n",
       "society.\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<p>\n",
       "Observe the accommodation of the most common artificer or daylabourer in a\n",
       "civilized and thriving country, and you will perceive that the number of\n",
       "people, of whose industry a part, though but a small part, has been employed in\n",
       "procuring him this accommodation, exceeds all computation. The woollen coat,\n",
       "for example, which covers the day-labourer, as coarse and rough as it may\n",
       "appear, is the produce of the joint labour of a great multitude of workmen. The\n",
       "shepherd, the sorter of the wool, the wool-comber or carder, the dyer, the\n",
       "scribbler, the spinner, the weaver, the fuller, the dresser, with many others,\n",
       "must all join their different arts in order to complete even this homely\n",
       "production. How many merchants and carriers, besides, must have been employed\n",
       "in transporting the materials from some of those workmen to others who often\n",
       "live in a very distant part of the country? How much commerce and navigation in\n",
       "particular, how many ship-builders, sailors, sail-makers, rope-makers, must\n",
       "have been employed in order to bring together the different drugs made use of\n",
       "by the dyer, which often come from the remotest corners of the world? What a\n",
       "variety of labour, too, is necessary in order to produce the tools of the\n",
       "meanest of those workmen! To say nothing of such complicated machines as the\n",
       "ship of the sailor, the mill of the fuller, or even the loom of the weaver, let\n",
       "us consider only what a variety of labour is requisite in order to form that\n",
       "very simple machine, the shears with which the shepherd clips the wool. The\n",

      "the head too he is obliged to change his tools. The different opera-\n",
      "tions into which the making of a pin, or of a metal button, is\n",
      "subdivided, are all of them much more simple, and the dexterity\n",
      "of the person, of whose life it has been the sole business to perform\n",

      "what the human hand could, by those who had never seen\n",
      "them, be supposed capable of acquiring.\n",
      "Secondly, the advantage which is gained by saving the time\n",
      "commonly lost in passing from one sort of work to another is much\n",
      "greater than we should at first view be apt to imagine it. It is\n",
      "impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another\n",

       "'\\r\\nThe greatest improvements in the productive powers of labour, and the greater\\r\\npart of the skill, dexterity, and judgment, with which it is anywhere directed,\\r\\nor applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labour. The\\r\\neffects of the division of labour, in the general business of society, will be\\r\\nmore easily understood, by considering in what manner it operates in some\\r\\nparticular manufactures. It is commonly supposed to be carried furthest in some\\r\\nvery trifling ones; not perhaps that it really is carried further in them than\\r\\nin others of more importance: but in those trifling manufactures which are\\r\\ndestined to supply the small wants of but a small number of people, the whole\\r\\nnumber of workmen must necessarily be small; and those employed in every\\r\\ndifferent branch of the work can often be collected into the same workhouse,\\r\\nand placed at once under the view of the spectator.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn those great manufactures, on the contrary, which are destined to supply the\\r\\ngreat wants of the great body of the people, every different branch of the work\\r\\nemploys so great a number of workmen, that it is impossible to collect them all\\r\\ninto the same workhouse. We can seldom see more, at one time, than those\\r\\nemployed in one single branch. Though in such manufactures, therefore, the work\\r\\nmay really be divided into a much greater number of parts, than in those of a\\r\\nmore trifling nature, the division is not near so obvious, and has accordingly\\r\\nbeen much less observed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufacture, but one in\\r\\nwhich the division of labour has been very often taken notice of, the trade of\\r\\na pin-maker: a workman not educated to this business (which the division of\\r\\nlabour has rendered a distinct trade), nor acquainted with the use of the\\r\\nmachinery employed in it (to the invention of which the same division of labour\\r\\nhas probably given occasion), could scarce, perhaps, with his utmost industry,\\r\\nmake one pin in a day, and certainly could not make twenty. But in the way in\\r\\nwhich this business is now carried on, not only the whole work is a peculiar\\r\\ntrade, but it is divided into a number of branches, of which the greater part\\r\\nare likewise peculiar trades. One man draws out the wire; another straights it;\\r\\na third cuts it; a fourth points it; a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving\\r\\nthe head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it\\r\\non is a peculiar business; to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by\\r\\nitself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin\\r\\nis, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in\\r\\nsome manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though in others the\\r\\nsame man will sometimes perform two or three of them. I have seen a small\\r\\nmanufactory of this kind, where ten men only were employed, and where some of\\r\\nthem consequently performed two or three distinct operations. But though they\\r\\nwere very poor, and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary\\r\\nmachinery, they could, when they exerted themselves, make among them about\\r\\ntwelve pounds of pins in a day. There are in a pound upwards of four thousand\\r\\npins of a middling size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them\\r\\nupwards of forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a\\r\\ntenth part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four\\r\\nthousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately\\r\\nand independently, and without any of them having been educated to this\\r\\npeculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty,\\r\\nperhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two hundred and\\r\\nfortieth, perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth, part of what they are\\r\\nat present capable of performing, in consequence of a proper division and\\r\\ncombination of their different operations.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn every other art and manufacture, the effects of the division of labour are\\r\\nsimilar to what they are in this very trifling one, though, in many of them,\\r\\nthe labour can neither be so much subdivided, nor reduced to so great a\\r\\nsimplicity of operation. The division of labour, however, so far as it can be\\r\\nintroduced, occasions, in every art, a proportionable increase of the\\r\\nproductive powers of labour. The separation of different trades and employments\\r\\nfrom one another, seems to have taken place in consequence of this advantage.\\r\\nThis separation, too, is generally carried furthest in those countries which\\r\\nenjoy the highest degree of industry and improvement; what is the work of one\\r\\nman, in a rude state of society, being generally that of several in an improved\\r\\none. In every improved society, the farmer is generally nothing but a farmer;\\r\\nthe manufacturer, nothing but a manufacturer. The labour, too, which is\\r\\nnecessary to produce any one complete manufacture, is almost always divided\\r\\namong a great number of hands. How many different trades are employed in each\\r\\nbranch of the linen and woollen manufactures, from the growers of the flax and\\r\\nthe wool, to the bleachers and smoothers of the linen, or to the dyers and\\r\\ndressers of the cloth! The nature of agriculture, indeed, does not admit of so\\r\\nmany subdivisions of labour, nor of so complete a separation of one business\\r\\nfrom another, as manufactures. It is impossible to separate so entirely the\\r\\nbusiness of the grazier from that of the corn-farmer, as the trade of the\\r\\ncarpenter is commonly separated from that of the smith. The spinner is almost\\r\\nalways a distinct person from the weaver; but the ploughman, the harrower, the\\r\\nsower of the seed, and the reaper of the corn, are often the same. The\\r\\noccasions for those different sorts of labour returning with the different\\r\\nseasons of the year, it is impossible that one man should be constantly\\r\\nemployed in any one of them. This impossibility of making so complete and\\r\\nentire a separation of all the different branches of labour employed in\\r\\nagriculture, is perhaps the reason why the improvement of the productive powers\\r\\nof labour, in this art, does not always keep pace with their improvement in\\r\\nmanufactures. The most opulent nations, indeed, generally excel all their\\r\\nneighbours in agriculture as well as in manufactures; but they are commonly\\r\\nmore distinguished by their superiority in the latter than in the former. Their\\r\\nlands are in general better cultivated, and having more labour and expense\\r\\nbestowed upon them, produce more in proportion to the extent and natural\\r\\nfertility of the ground. But this superiority of produce is seldom much more\\r\\nthan in proportion to the superiority of labour and expense. In agriculture,\\r\\nthe labour of the rich country is not always much more productive than that of\\r\\nthe poor; or, at least, it is never so much more productive, as it commonly is\\r\\nin manufactures. The corn of the rich country, therefore, will not always, in\\r\\nthe same degree of goodness, come cheaper to market than that of the poor. The\\r\\ncorn of Poland, in the same degree of goodness, is as cheap as that of France,\\r\\nnotwithstanding the superior opulence and improvement of the latter country.\\r\\nThe corn of France is, in the corn-provinces, fully as good, and in most years\\r\\nnearly about the same price with the corn of England, though, in opulence and\\r\\nimprovement, France is perhaps inferior to England. The corn-lands of England,\\r\\nhowever, are better cultivated than those of France, and the corn-lands of\\r\\nFrance are said to be much better cultivated than those of Poland. But though\\r\\nthe poor country, notwithstanding the inferiority of its cultivation, can, in\\r\\nsome measure, rival the rich in the cheapness and goodness of its corn, it can\\r\\npretend to no such competition in its manufactures, at least if those\\r\\nmanufactures suit the soil, climate, and situation, of the rich country. The\\r\\nsilks of France are better and cheaper than those of England, because the silk\\r\\nmanufacture, at least under the present high duties upon the importation of raw\\r\\nsilk, does not so well suit the climate of England as that of France. But the\\r\\nhardware and the coarse woollens of England are beyond all comparison superior\\r\\nto those of France, and much cheaper, too, in the same degree of goodness. In\\r\\nPoland there are said to be scarce any manufactures of any kind, a few of those\\r\\ncoarser household manufactures excepted, without which no country can well\\r\\nsubsist.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis great increase in the quantity of work, which, in consequence of the\\r\\ndivision of labour, the same number of people are capable of performing, is\\r\\nowing to three different circumstances; first, to the increase of dexterity in\\r\\nevery particular workman; secondly, to the saving of the time which is commonly\\r\\nlost in passing from one species of work to another; and, lastly, to the\\r\\ninvention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labour,\\r\\nand enable one man to do the work of many.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFirst, the improvement of the dexterity of the workmen, necessarily increases\\r\\nthe quantity of the work he can perform; and the division of labour, by\\r\\nreducing every man’s business to some one simple operation, and by making\\r\\nthis operation the sole employment of his life, necessarily increases very much\\r\\nthe dexterity of the workman. A common smith, who, though accustomed to handle\\r\\nthe hammer, has never been used to make nails, if, upon some particular\\r\\noccasion, he is obliged to attempt it, will scarce, I am assured, be able to\\r\\nmake above two or three hundred nails in a day, and those, too, very bad ones.\\r\\nA smith who has been accustomed to make nails, but whose sole or principal\\r\\nbusiness has not been that of a nailer, can seldom, with his utmost diligence,\\r\\nmake more than eight hundred or a thousand nails in a day. I have seen several\\r\\nboys, under twenty years of age, who had never exercised any other trade but\\r\\nthat of making nails, and who, when they exerted themselves, could make, each\\r\\nof them, upwards of two thousand three hundred nails in a day. The making of a\\r\\nnail, however, is by no means one of the simplest operations. The same person\\r\\nblows the bellows, stirs or mends the fire as there is occasion, heats the\\r\\niron, and forges every part of the nail: in forging the head, too, he is\\r\\nobliged to change his tools. The different operations into which the making of\\r\\na pin, or of a metal button, is subdivided, are all of them much more simple,\\r\\nand the dexterity of the person, of whose life it has been the sole business to\\r\\nperform them, is usually much greater. The rapidity with which some of the\\r\\noperations of those manufactures are performed, exceeds what the human hand\\r\\ncould, by those who had never seen them, be supposed capable of acquiring.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSecondly, the advantage which is gained by saving the time commonly lost in\\r\\npassing from one sort of work to another, is much greater than we should at\\r\\nfirst view be apt to imagine it. It is impossible to pass very quickly from one\\r\\nkind of work to another, that is carried on in a different place, and with\\r\\nquite different tools. A country weaver, who cultivates a small farm, must lose\\r\\na good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field, and from the field\\r\\nto his loom. When the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse, the\\r\\nloss of time is, no doubt, much less. It is, even in this case, however, very\\r\\nconsiderable. A man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one\\r\\nsort of employment to another. When he first begins the new work, he is seldom\\r\\nvery keen and hearty; his mind, as they say, does not go to it, and for some\\r\\ntime he rather trifles than applies to good purpose. The habit of sauntering,\\r\\nand of indolent careless application, which is naturally, or rather\\r\\nnecessarily, acquired by every country workman who is obliged to change his\\r\\nwork and his tools every half hour, and to apply his hand in twenty different\\r\\nways almost every day of his life, renders him almost always slothful and lazy,\\r\\nand incapable of any vigorous application, even on the most pressing occasions.\\r\\nIndependent, therefore, of his deficiency in point of dexterity, this cause\\r\\nalone must always reduce considerably the quantity of work which he is capable\\r\\nof performing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThirdly, and lastly, everybody must be sensible how much labour is facilitated\\r\\nand abridged by the application of proper machinery. It is unnecessary to give\\r\\nany example. I shall only observe, therefore, that the invention of all those\\r\\nmachines by which labour is so much facilitated and abridged, seems to have\\r\\nbeen originally owing to the division of labour. Men are much more likely to\\r\\ndiscover easier and readier methods of attaining any object, when the whole\\r\\nattention of their minds is directed towards that single object, than when it\\r\\nis dissipated among a great variety of things. But, in consequence of the\\r\\ndivision of labour, the whole of every man’s attention comes naturally to\\r\\nbe directed towards some one very simple object. It is naturally to be\\r\\nexpected, therefore, that some one or other of those who are employed in each\\r\\nparticular branch of labour should soon find out easier and readier methods of\\r\\nperforming their own particular work, whenever the nature of it admits of such\\r\\nimprovement. A great part of the machines made use of in those manufactures in\\r\\nwhich labour is most subdivided, were originally the invention of common\\r\\nworkmen, who, being each of them employed in some very simple operation,\\r\\nnaturally turned their thoughts towards finding out easier and readier methods\\r\\nof performing it. Whoever has been much accustomed to visit such manufactures,\\r\\nmust frequently have been shewn very pretty machines, which were the inventions\\r\\nof such workmen, in order to facilitate and quicken their own particular part\\r\\nof the work. In the first fire engines {this was the current designation for\\r\\nsteam engines}, a boy was constantly employed to open and shut alternately the\\r\\ncommunication between the boiler and the cylinder, according as the piston\\r\\neither ascended or descended. One of those boys, who loved to play with his\\r\\ncompanions, observed that, by tying a string from the handle of the valve which\\r\\nopened this communication to another part of the machine, the valve would open\\r\\nand shut without his assistance, and leave him at liberty to divert himself\\r\\nwith his play-fellows. One of the greatest improvements that has been made upon\\r\\nthis machine, since it was first invented, was in this manner the discovery of\\r\\na boy who wanted to save his own labour.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAll the improvements in machinery, however, have by no means been the\\r\\ninventions of those who had occasion to use the machines. Many improvements\\r\\nhave been made by the ingenuity of the makers of the machines, when to make\\r\\nthem became the business of a peculiar trade; and some by that of those who are\\r\\ncalled philosophers, or men of speculation, whose trade it is not to do any\\r\\nthing, but to observe every thing, and who, upon that account, are often\\r\\ncapable of combining together the powers of the most distant and dissimilar\\r\\nobjects in the progress of society, philosophy or speculation becomes, like\\r\\nevery other employment, the principal or sole trade and occupation of a\\r\\nparticular class of citizens. Like every other employment, too, it is\\r\\nsubdivided into a great number of different branches, each of which affords\\r\\noccupation to a peculiar tribe or class of philosophers; and this subdivision\\r\\nof employment in philosophy, as well as in every other business, improves\\r\\ndexterity, and saves time. Each individual becomes more expert in his own\\r\\npeculiar branch, more work is done upon the whole, and the quantity of science\\r\\nis considerably increased by it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt is the great multiplication of the productions of all the different arts, in\\r\\nconsequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed\\r\\nsociety, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of\\r\\nthe people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of\\r\\nbeyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly\\r\\nin the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own\\r\\ngoods for a great quantity or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a\\r\\ngreat quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have\\r\\noccasion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for,\\r\\nand a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of the\\r\\nsociety.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nObserve the accommodation of the most common artificer or daylabourer in a\\r\\ncivilized and thriving country, and you will perceive that the number of\\r\\npeople, of whose industry a part, though but a small part, has been employed in\\r\\nprocuring him this accommodation, exceeds all computation. The woollen coat,\\r\\nfor example, which covers the day-labourer, as coarse and rough as it may\\r\\nappear, is the produce of the joint labour of a great multitude of workmen. The\\r\\nshepherd, the sorter of the wool, the wool-comber or carder, the dyer, the\\r\\nscribbler, the spinner, the weaver, the fuller, the dresser, with many others,\\r\\nmust all join their different arts in order to complete even this homely\\r\\nproduction. How many merchants and carriers, besides, must have been employed\\r\\nin transporting the materials from some of those workmen to others who often\\r\\nlive in a very distant part of the country? How much commerce and navigation in\\r\\nparticular, how many ship-builders, sailors, sail-makers, rope-makers, must\\r\\nhave been employed in order to bring together the different drugs made use of\\r\\nby the dyer, which often come from the remotest corners of the world? What a\\r\\nvariety of labour, too, is necessary in order to produce the tools of the\\r\\nmeanest of those workmen! To say nothing of such complicated machines as the\\r\\nship of the sailor, the mill of the fuller, or even the loom of the weaver, let\\r\\nus consider only what a variety of labour is requisite in order to form that\\r\\nvery simple machine, the shears with which the shepherd clips the wool. The\\r\\nminer, the builder of the furnace for smelting the ore, the feller of the\\r\\ntimber, the burner of the charcoal to be made use of in the smelting-house, the\\r\\nbrickmaker, the bricklayer, the workmen who attend the furnace, the millwright,\\r\\nthe forger, the smith, must all of them join their different arts in order to\\r\\nproduce them. Were we to examine, in the same manner, all the different parts\\r\\nof his dress and household furniture, the coarse linen shirt which he wears\\r\\nnext his skin, the shoes which cover his feet, the bed which he lies on, and\\r\\nall the different parts which compose it, the kitchen-grate at which he\\r\\nprepares his victuals, the coals which he makes use of for that purpose, dug\\r\\nfrom the bowels of the earth, and brought to him, perhaps, by a long sea and a\\r\\nlong land-carriage, all the other utensils of his kitchen, all the furniture of\\r\\nhis table, the knives and forks, the earthen or pewter plates upon which he\\r\\nserves up and divides his victuals, the different hands employed in preparing\\r\\nhis bread and his beer, the glass window which lets in the heat and the light,\\r\\nand keeps out the wind and the rain, with all the knowledge and art requisite\\r\\nfor preparing that beautiful and happy invention, without which these northern\\r\\nparts of the world could scarce have afforded a very comfortable habitation,\\r\\ntogether with the tools of all the different workmen employed in producing\\r\\nthose different conveniencies; if we examine, I say, all these things, and\\r\\nconsider what a variety of labour is employed about each of them, we shall be\\r\\nsensible that, without the assistance and co-operation of many thousands, the\\r\\nvery meanest person in a civilized country could not be provided, even\\r\\naccording to, what we very falsely imagine, the easy and simple manner in which\\r\\nhe is commonly accommodated. Compared, indeed, with the more extravagant luxury\\r\\nof the great, his accommodation must no doubt appear extremely simple and easy;\\r\\nand yet it may be true, perhaps, that the accommodation of an European prince\\r\\ndoes not always so much exceed that of an industrious and frugal peasant, as\\r\\nthe accommodation of the latter exceeds that of many an African king, the\\r\\nabsolute masters of the lives and liberties of ten thousand naked savages.\\r\\n'"

       "'the greatest improvements in the productive powers of labour and the greater part of the skill dexterity and judgment with which it is anywhere directed or applied seem to have been the effects of the division of labour. the effects of the division of labour in the general business of society will be more easily understood by considering in what manner it operates in some particular manufactures. it is commonly supposed to be carried furthest in some very trifling ones not perhaps that it really is carried further in them than in others of more importance but in those trifling manufactures which are destined to supply the small wants of but a small number of people the whole number of workmen must necessarily be small and those employed in every different branch of the work can often be collected into the same workhouse and placed at once under the view of the spectator. in those great manufactures on the contrary which are destined to supply the great wants of the great body of the people every different branch of the work employs so great a number of workmen that it is impossible to collect them all into the same workhouse. we can seldom see more at one time than those employed in one single branch. though in such manufactures therefore the work may really be divided into a much greater number of parts than in those of a more trifling nature the division is not near so obvious and has accordingly been much less observed. to take an example therefore from a very trifling manufacture but one in which the division of labour has been very often taken notice of the trade of a pinmaker a workman not educated to this business which the division of labour has rendered a distinct trade nor acquainted with the use of the machinery employed in it to the invention of which the same division of labour has probably given occasion could scarce perhaps with his utmost industry make one pin in a day and certainly could not make twenty. but in the way in which this business is now carried on not only the whole work is a peculiar trade but it is divided into a number of branches of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper and the important business of making a pin is in this manner divided into about eighteen distinct operations which in some manufactories are all performed by distinct hands though in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them. i have seen a small manufactory of this kind where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations. but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day. there are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling size. those ten persons therefore could make among them upwards of fortyeight thousand pins in a day. each person therefore making a tenth part of fortyeight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day. but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day that is certainly not the two hundred and fortieth perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth part of what they are at present capable of performing in consequence of a proper division and combination of their different operations. in every other art and manufacture the effects of the division of labour are similar to what they are in this very trifling one though in many of them the labour can neither be so much subdivided nor reduced to so great a simplicity of operation. the division of labour however so far as it can be introduced occasions in every art a proportionable increase of the productive powers of labour. the separation of different trades and employments from one another seems to have taken place in consequence of this advantage. this separation too is generally carried furthest in those countries which enjoy the highest degree of industry and improvement what is the work of one man in a rude state of society being generally that of several in an improved one. in every improved society the farmer is generally nothing but a farmer the manufacturer nothing but a manufacturer. the labour too which is necessary to produce any one complete manufacture is almost always divided among a great number of hands. how many different trades are employed in each branch of the linen and woollen manufactures from the growers of the flax and the wool to the bleachers and smoothers of the linen or to the dyers and dressers of the cloth the nature of agriculture indeed does not admit of so many subdivisions of labour nor of so complete a separation of one business from another as manufactures. it is impossible to separate so entirely the business of the grazier from that of the cornfarmer as the trade of the carpenter is commonly separated from that of the smith. the spinner is almost always a distinct person from the weaver but the ploughman the harrower the sower of the seed and the reaper of the corn are often the same. the occasions for those different sorts of labour returning with the different seasons of the year it is impossible that one man should be constantly employed in any one of them. this impossibility of making so complete and entire a separation of all the different branches of labour employed in agriculture is perhaps the reason why the improvement of the productive powers of labour in this art does not always keep pace with their improvement in manufactures. the most opulent nations indeed generally excel all their neighbours in agriculture as well as in manufactures but they are commonly more distinguished by their superiority in the latter than in the former. their lands are in general better cultivated and having more labour and expense bestowed upon them produce more in proportion to the extent and natural fertility of the ground. but this superiority of produce is seldom much more than in proportion to the superiority of labour and expense. in agriculture the labour of the rich country is not always much more productive than that of the poor or at least it is never so much more productive as it commonly is in manufactures. the corn of the rich country therefore will not always in the same degree of goodness come cheaper to market than that of the poor. the corn of poland in the same degree of goodness is as cheap as that of france notwithstanding the superior opulence and improvement of the latter country. the corn of france is in the cornprovinces fully as good and in most years nearly about the same price with the corn of england though in opulence and improvement france is perhaps inferior to england. the cornlands of england however are better cultivated than those of france and the cornlands of france are said to be much better cultivated than those of poland. but though the poor country notwithstanding the inferiority of its cultivation can in some measure rival the rich in the cheapness and goodness of its corn it can pretend to no such competition in its manufactures at least if those manufactures suit the soil climate and situation of the rich country. the silks of france are better and cheaper than those of england because the silk manufacture at least under the present high duties upon the importation of raw silk does not so well suit the climate of england as that of france. but the hardware and the coarse woollens of england are beyond all comparison superior to those of france and much cheaper too in the same degree of goodness. in poland there are said to be scarce any manufactures of any kind a few of those coarser household manufactures excepted without which no country can well subsist. this great increase in the quantity of work which in consequence of the division of labour the same number of people are capable of performing is owing to three different circumstances first to the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly to the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly to the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labour and enable one man to do the work of many. first the improvement of the dexterity of the workmen necessarily increases the quantity of the work he can perform and the division of labour by reducing every mans business to some one simple operation and by making this operation the sole employment of his life necessarily increases very much the dexterity of the workman. a common smith who though accustomed to handle the hammer has never been used to make nails if upon some particular occasion he is obliged to attempt it will scarce i am assured be able to make above two or three hundred nails in a day and those too very bad ones. a smith who has been accustomed to make nails but whose sole or principal business has not been that of a nailer can seldom with his utmost diligence make more than eight hundred or a thousand nails in a day. i have seen several boys under twenty years of age who had never exercised any other trade but that of making nails and who when they exerted themselves could make each of them upwards of two thousand three hundred nails in a day. the making of a nail however is by no means one of the simplest operations. the same person blows the bellows stirs or mends the fire as there is occasion heats the iron and forges every part of the nail in forging the head too he is obliged to change his tools. the different operations into which the making of a pin or of a metal button is subdivided are all of them much more simple and the dexterity of the person of whose life it has been the sole business to perform them is usually much greater. the rapidity with which some of the operations of those manufactures are performed exceeds what the human hand could by those who had never seen them be supposed capable of acquiring. secondly the advantage which is gained by saving the time commonly lost in passing from one sort of work to another is much greater than we should at first view be apt to imagine it. it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools. a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom. when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less. it is even in this case however very considerable. a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another. when he first begins the new work he is seldom very keen and hearty his mind as they say does not go to it and for some time he rather trifles than applies to good purpose. the habit of sauntering and of indolent careless application which is naturally or rather necessarily acquired by every country workman who is obliged to change his work and his tools every half hour and to apply his hand in twenty different ways almost every day of his life renders him almost always slothful and lazy and incapable of any vigorous application even on the most pressing occasions. independent therefore of his deficiency in point of dexterity this cause alone must always reduce considerably the quantity of work which he is capable of performing. thirdly and lastly everybody must be sensible how much labour is facilitated and abridged by the application of proper machinery. it is unnecessary to give any example. i shall only observe therefore that the invention of all those machines by which labour is so much facilitated and abridged seems to have been originally owing to the division of labour. men are much more likely to discover easier and readier methods of attaining any object when the whole attention of their minds is directed towards that single object than when it is dissipated among a great variety of things. but in consequence of the division of labour the whole of every mans attention comes naturally to be directed towards some one very simple object. it is naturally to be expected therefore that some one or other of those who are employed in each particular branch of labour should soon find out easier and readier methods of performing their own particular work whenever the nature of it admits of such improvement. a great part of the machines made use of in those manufactures in which labour is most subdivided were originally the invention of common workmen who being each of them employed in some very simple operation naturally turned their thoughts towards finding out easier and readier methods of performing it. whoever has been much accustomed to visit such manufactures must frequently have been shewn very pretty machines which were the inventions of such workmen in order to facilitate and quicken their own particular part of the work. in the first fire engines this was the current designation for steam engines a boy was constantly employed to open and shut alternately the communication between the boiler and the cylinder according as the piston either ascended or descended. one of those boys who loved to play with his companions observed that by tying a string from the handle of the valve which opened this communication to another part of the machine the valve would open and shut without his assistance and leave him at liberty to divert himself with his playfellows. one of the greatest improvements that has been made upon this machine since it was first invented was in this manner the discovery of a boy who wanted to save his own labour. all the improvements in machinery however have by no means been the inventions of those who had occasion to use the machines. many improvements have been made by the ingenuity of the makers of the machines when to make them became the'"

       "'\\r\\nThe greatest improvements in the productive powers of labour, and the greater\\r\\npart of the skill, dexterity, and judgment, with which it is anywhere directed,\\r\\nor applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labour. The\\r\\neffects of the division of labour, in the general business of society, will be\\r\\nmore easily understood, by considering in what manner it operates in some\\r\\nparticular manufactures. It is commonly supposed to be carried furthest in some\\r\\nvery trifling ones; not perhaps that it really is carried further in them than\\r\\nin others of more importance: but in those trifling manufactures which are\\r\\ndestined to supply the small wants of but a small number of people, the whole\\r\\nnumber of workmen must necessarily be small; and those employed in every\\r\\ndifferent branch of the work can often be collected into the same workhouse,\\r\\nand placed at once under the view of the spectator.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn those great manufactures, on the contrary, which are destined to supply the\\r\\ngreat wants of the great body of the people, every different branch of the work\\r\\nemploys so great a number of workmen, that it is impossible to collect them all\\r\\ninto the same workhouse. We can seldom see more, at one time, than those\\r\\nemployed in one single branch. Though in such manufactures, therefore, the work\\r\\nmay really be divided into a much greater number of parts, than in those of a\\r\\nmore trifling nature, the division is not near so obvious, and has accordingly\\r\\nbeen much less observed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufacture, but one in\\r\\nwhich the division of labour has been very often taken notice of, the trade of\\r\\na pin-maker: a workman not educated to this business (which the division of\\r\\nlabour has rendered a distinct trade), nor acquainted with the use of the\\r\\nmachinery employed in it (to the invention of which the same division of labour\\r\\nhas probably given occasion), could scarce, perhaps, with his utmost industry,\\r\\nmake one pin in a day, and certainly could not make twenty. But in the way in\\r\\nwhich this business is now carried on, not only the whole work is a peculiar\\r\\ntrade, but it is divided into a number of branches, of which the greater part\\r\\nare likewise peculiar trades. One man draws out the wire; another straights it;\\r\\na third cuts it; a fourth points it; a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving\\r\\nthe head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it\\r\\non is a peculiar business; to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by\\r\\nitself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin\\r\\nis, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in\\r\\nsome manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though in others the\\r\\nsame man will sometimes perform two or three of them. I have seen a small\\r\\nmanufactory of this kind, where ten men only were employed, and where some of\\r\\nthem consequently performed two or three distinct operations. But though they\\r\\nwere very poor, and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary\\r\\nmachinery, they could, when they exerted themselves, make among them about\\r\\ntwelve pounds of pins in a day. There are in a pound upwards of four thousand\\r\\npins of a middling size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them\\r\\nupwards of forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a\\r\\ntenth part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four\\r\\nthousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately\\r\\nand independently, and without any of them having been educated to this\\r\\npeculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty,\\r\\nperhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two hundred and\\r\\nfortieth, perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth, part of what they are\\r\\nat present capable of performing, in consequence of a proper division and\\r\\ncombination of their different operations.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn every other art and manufacture, the effects of the division of labour are\\r\\nsimilar to what they are in this very trifling one, though, in many of them,\\r\\nthe labour can neither be so much subdivided, nor reduced to so great a\\r\\nsimplicity of operation. The division of labour, however, so far as it can be\\r\\nintroduced, occasions, in every art, a proportionable increase of the\\r\\nproductive powers of labour. The separation of different trades and employments\\r\\nfrom one another, seems to have taken place in consequence of this advantage.\\r\\nThis separation, too, is generally carried furthest in those countries which\\r\\nenjoy the highest degree of industry and improvement; what is the work of one\\r\\nman, in a rude state of society, being generally that of several in an improved\\r\\none. In every improved society, the farmer is generally nothing but a farmer;\\r\\nthe manufacturer, nothing but a manufacturer. The labour, too, which is\\r\\nnecessary to produce any one complete manufacture, is almost always divided\\r\\namong a great number of hands. How many different trades are employed in each\\r\\nbranch of the linen and woollen manufactures, from the growers of the flax and\\r\\nthe wool, to the bleachers and smoothers of the linen, or to the dyers and\\r\\ndressers of the cloth! The nature of agriculture, indeed, does not admit of so\\r\\nmany subdivisions of labour, nor of so complete a separation of one business\\r\\nfrom another, as manufactures. It is impossible to separate so entirely the\\r\\nbusiness of the grazier from that of the corn-farmer, as the trade of the\\r\\ncarpenter is commonly separated from that of the smith. The spinner is almost\\r\\nalways a distinct person from the weaver; but the ploughman, the harrower, the\\r\\nsower of the seed, and the reaper of the corn, are often the same. The\\r\\noccasions for those different sorts of labour returning with the different\\r\\nseasons of the year, it is impossible that one man should be constantly\\r\\nemployed in any one of them. This impossibility of making so complete and\\r\\nentire a separation of all the different branches of labour employed in\\r\\nagriculture, is perhaps the reason why the improvement of the productive powers\\r\\nof labour, in this art, does not always keep pace with their improvement in\\r\\nmanufactures. The most opulent nations, indeed, generally excel all their\\r\\nneighbours in agriculture as well as in manufactures; but they are commonly\\r\\nmore distinguished by their superiority in the latter than in the former. Their\\r\\nlands are in general better cultivated, and having more labour and expense\\r\\nbestowed upon them, produce more in proportion to the extent and natural\\r\\nfertility of the ground. But this superiority of produce is seldom much more\\r\\nthan in proportion to the superiority of labour and expense. In agriculture,\\r\\nthe labour of the rich country is not always much more productive than that of\\r\\nthe poor; or, at least, it is never so much more productive, as it commonly is\\r\\nin manufactures. The corn of the rich country, therefore, will not always, in\\r\\nthe same degree of goodness, come cheaper to market than that of the poor. The\\r\\ncorn of Poland, in the same degree of goodness, is as cheap as that of France,\\r\\nnotwithstanding the superior opulence and improvement of the latter country.\\r\\nThe corn of France is, in the corn-provinces, fully as good, and in most years\\r\\nnearly about the same price with the corn of England, though, in opulence and\\r\\nimprovement, France is perhaps inferior to England. The corn-lands of England,\\r\\nhowever, are better cultivated than those of France, and the corn-lands of\\r\\nFrance are said to be much better cultivated than those of Poland. But though\\r\\nthe poor country, notwithstanding the inferiority of its cultivation, can, in\\r\\nsome measure, rival the rich in the cheapness and goodness of its corn, it can\\r\\npretend to no such competition in its manufactures, at least if those\\r\\nmanufactures suit the soil, climate, and situation, of the rich country. The\\r\\nsilks of France are better and cheaper than those of England, because the silk\\r\\nmanufacture, at least under the present high duties upon the importation of raw\\r\\nsilk, does not so well suit the climate of England as that of France. But the\\r\\nhardware and the coarse woollens of England are beyond all comparison superior\\r\\nto those of France, and much cheaper, too, in the same degree of goodness. In\\r\\nPoland there are said to be scarce any manufactures of any kind, a few of those\\r\\ncoarser household manufactures excepted, without which no country can well\\r\\nsubsist.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis great increase in the quantity of work, which, in consequence of the\\r\\ndivision of labour, the same number of people are capable of performing, is\\r\\nowing to three different circumstances; first, to the increase of dexterity in\\r\\nevery particular workman; secondly, to the saving of the time which is commonly\\r\\nlost in passing from one species of work to another; and, lastly, to the\\r\\ninvention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labour,\\r\\nand enable one man to do the work of many.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFirst, the improvement of the dexterity of the workmen, necessarily increases\\r\\nthe quantity of the work he can perform; and the division of labour, by\\r\\nreducing every man’s business to some one simple operation, and by making\\r\\nthis operation the sole employment of his life, necessarily increases very much\\r\\nthe dexterity of the workman. A common smith, who, though accustomed to handle\\r\\nthe hammer, has never been used to make nails, if, upon some particular\\r\\noccasion, he is obliged to attempt it, will scarce, I am assured, be able to\\r\\nmake above two or three hundred nails in a day, and those, too, very bad ones.\\r\\nA smith who has been accustomed to make nails, but whose sole or principal\\r\\nbusiness has not been that of a nailer, can seldom, with his utmost diligence,\\r\\nmake more than eight hundred or a thousand nails in a day. I have seen several\\r\\nboys, under twenty years of age, who had never exercised any other trade but\\r\\nthat of making nails, and who, when they exerted themselves, could make, each\\r\\nof them, upwards of two thousand three hundred nails in a day. The making of a\\r\\nnail, however, is by no means one of the simplest operations. The same person\\r\\nblows the bellows, stirs or mends the fire as there is occasion, heats the\\r\\niron, and forges every part of the nail: in forging the head, too, he is\\r\\nobliged to change his tools. The different operations into which the making of\\r\\na pin, or of a metal button, is subdivided, are all of them much more simple,\\r\\nand the dexterity of the person, of whose life it has been the sole business to\\r\\nperform them, is usually much greater. The rapidity with which some of the\\r\\noperations of those manufactures are performed, exceeds what the human hand\\r\\ncould, by those who had never seen them, be supposed capable of acquiring.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSecondly, the advantage which is gained by saving the time commonly lost in\\r\\npassing from one sort of work to another, is much greater than we should at\\r\\nfirst view be apt to imagine it. It is impossible to pass very quickly from one\\r\\nkind of work to another, that is carried on in a different place, and with\\r\\nquite different tools. A country weaver, who cultivates a small farm, must lose\\r\\na good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field, and from the field\\r\\nto his loom. When the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse, the\\r\\nloss of time is, no doubt, much less. It is, even in this case, however, very\\r\\nconsiderable. A man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one\\r\\nsort of employment to another. When he first begins the new work, he is seldom\\r\\nvery keen and hearty; his mind, as they say, does not go to it, and for some\\r\\ntime he rather trifles than applies to good purpose. The habit of sauntering,\\r\\nand of indolent careless application, which is naturally, or rather\\r\\nnecessarily, acquired by every country workman who is obliged to change his\\r\\nwork and his tools every half hour, and to apply his hand in twenty different\\r\\nways almost every day of his life, renders him almost always slothful and lazy,\\r\\nand incapable of any vigorous application, even on the most pressing occasions.\\r\\nIndependent, therefore, of his deficiency in point of dexterity, this cause\\r\\nalone must always reduce considerably the quantity of work which he is capable\\r\\nof performing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThirdly, and lastly, everybody must be sensible how much labour is facilitated\\r\\nand abridged by the application of proper machinery. It is unnecessary to give\\r\\nany example. I shall only observe, therefore, that the invention of all those\\r\\nmachines by which labour is so much facilitated and abridged, seems to have\\r\\nbeen originally owing to the division of labour. Men are much more likely to\\r\\ndiscover easier and readier methods of attaining any object, when the whole\\r\\nattention of their minds is directed towards that single object, than when it\\r\\nis dissipated among a great variety of things. But, in consequence of the\\r\\ndivision of labour, the whole of every man’s attention comes naturally to\\r\\nbe directed towards some one very simple object. It is naturally to be\\r\\nexpected, therefore, that some one or other of those who are employed in each\\r\\nparticular branch of labour should soon find out easier and readier methods of\\r\\nperforming their own particular work, whenever the nature of it admits of such\\r\\nimprovement. A great part of the machines made use of in those manufactures in\\r\\nwhich labour is most subdivided, were originally the invention of common\\r\\nworkmen, who, being each of them employed in some very simple operation,\\r\\nnaturally turned their thoughts towards finding out easier and readier methods\\r\\nof performing it. Whoever has been much accustomed to visit such manufactures,\\r\\nmust frequently have been shewn very pretty machines, which were the inventions\\r\\nof such workmen, in order to facilitate and quicken their own particular part\\r\\nof the work. In the first fire engines {this was the current designation for\\r\\nsteam engines}, a boy was constantly employed to open and shut alternately the\\r\\ncommunication between the boiler and the cylinder, according as the piston\\r\\neither ascended or descended. One of those boys, who loved to play with his\\r\\ncompanions, observed that, by tying a string from the handle of the valve which\\r\\nopened this communication to another part of the machine, the valve would open\\r\\nand shut without his assistance, and leave him at liberty to divert himself\\r\\nwith his play-fellows. One of the greatest improvements that has been made upon\\r\\nthis machine, since it was first invented, was in this manner the discovery of\\r\\na boy who wanted to save his own labour.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAll the improvements in machinery, however, have by no means been the\\r\\ninventions of those who had occasion to use the machines. Many improvements\\r\\nhave been made by the ingenuity of the makers of the machines, when to make\\r\\nthem became the business of a peculiar trade; and some by that of those who are\\r\\ncalled philosophers, or men of speculation, whose trade it is not to do any\\r\\nthing, but to observe every thing, and who, upon that account, are often\\r\\ncapable of combining together the powers of the most distant and dissimilar\\r\\nobjects in the progress of society, philosophy or speculation becomes, like\\r\\nevery other employment, the principal or sole trade and occupation of a\\r\\nparticular class of citizens. Like every other employment, too, it is\\r\\nsubdivided into a great number of different branches, each of which affords\\r\\noccupation to a peculiar tribe or class of philosophers; and this subdivision\\r\\nof employment in philosophy, as well as in every other business, improves\\r\\ndexterity, and saves time. Each individual becomes more expert in his own\\r\\npeculiar branch, more work is done upon the whole, and the quantity of science\\r\\nis considerably increased by it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt is the great multiplication of the productions of all the different arts, in\\r\\nconsequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed\\r\\nsociety, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of\\r\\nthe people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of\\r\\nbeyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly\\r\\nin the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own\\r\\ngoods for a great quantity or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a\\r\\ngreat quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have\\r\\noccasion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for,\\r\\nand a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of the\\r\\nsociety.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nObserve the accommodation of the most common artificer or daylabourer in a\\r\\ncivilized and thriving country, and you will perceive that the number of\\r\\npeople, of whose industry a part, though but a small part, has been employed in\\r\\nprocuring him this accommodation, exceeds all computation. The woollen coat,\\r\\nfor example, which covers the day-labourer, as coarse and rough as it may\\r\\nappear, is the produce of the joint labour of a great multitude of workmen. The\\r\\nshepherd, the sorter of the wool, the wool-comber or carder, the dyer, the\\r\\nscribbler, the spinner, the weaver, the fuller, the dresser, with many others,\\r\\nmust all join their different arts in order to complete even this homely\\r\\nproduction. How many merchants and carriers, besides, must have been employed\\r\\nin transporting the materials from some of those workmen to others who often\\r\\nlive in a very distant part of the country? How much commerce and navigation in\\r\\nparticular, how many ship-builders, sailors, sail-makers, rope-makers, must\\r\\nhave been employed in order to bring together the different drugs made use of\\r\\nby the dyer, which often come from the remotest corners of the world? What a\\r\\nvariety of labour, too, is necessary in order to produce the tools of the\\r\\nmeanest of those workmen! To say nothing of such complicated machines as the\\r\\nship of the sailor, the mill of the fuller, or even the loom of the weaver, let\\r\\nus consider only what a variety of labour is requisite in order to form that\\r\\nvery simple machine, the shears with which the shepherd clips the wool. The\\r\\nminer, the builder of the furnace for smelting the ore, the feller of the\\r\\ntimber, the burner of the charcoal to be made use of in the smelting-house, the\\r\\nbrickmaker, the bricklayer, the workmen who attend the furnace, the millwright,\\r\\nthe forger, the smith, must all of them join their different arts in order to\\r\\nproduce them. Were we to examine, in the same manner, all the different parts\\r\\nof his dress and household furniture, the coarse linen shirt which he wears\\r\\nnext his skin, the shoes which cover his feet, the bed which he lies on, and\\r\\nall the different parts which compose it, the kitchen-grate at which he\\r\\nprepares his victuals, the coals which he makes use of for that purpose, dug\\r\\nfrom the bowels of the earth, and brought to him, perhaps, by a long sea and a\\r\\nlong land-carriage, all the other utensils of his kitchen, all the furniture of\\r\\nhis table, the knives and forks, the earthen or pewter plates upon which he\\r\\nserves up and divides his victuals, the different hands employed in preparing\\r\\nhis bread and his beer, the glass window which lets in the heat and the light,\\r\\nand keeps out the wind and the rain, with all the knowledge and art requisite\\r\\nfor preparing that beautiful and happy invention, without which these northern\\r\\nparts of the world could scarce have afforded a very comfortable habitation,\\r\\ntogether with the tools of all the different workmen employed in producing\\r\\nthose different conveniencies; if we examine, I say, all these things, and\\r\\nconsider what a variety of labour is employed about each of them, we shall be\\r\\nsensible that, without the assistance and co-operation of many thousands, the\\r\\nvery meanest person in a civilized country could not be provided, even\\r\\naccording to, what we very falsely imagine, the easy and simple manner in which\\r\\nhe is commonly accommodated. Compared, indeed, with the more extravagant luxury\\r\\nof the great, his accommodation must no doubt appear extremely simple and easy;\\r\\nand yet it may be true, perhaps, that the accommodation of an European prince\\r\\ndoes not always so much exceed that of an industrious and frugal peasant, as\\r\\nthe accommodation of the latter exceeds that of many an African king, the\\r\\nabsolute masters of the lives and liberties of ten thousand naked savages.\\r\\n'"

      "THE greatest improvement in the productive powers of labour, and the greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which it is anywhere directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labour. The effects of the division of labour, in the general business of society, will be more easily understood by considering in what manner it operates in some particular manufactures. It is commonly supposed to be carried furthest in some very trifling ones; not perhaps that it really is carried further in them than in others of more importance: but in those trifling manufactures which are destined to supply the small wants of but a small number of people, the whole number of workmen must necessarily be small; and those employed in every different branch of the work can often be collected into the same workhouse, and placed at once under the view of the spectator. In those great manufactures, on the contrary, which are destined to supply the great wants of the great body of the people, every different branch of the work employs so great a number of workmen that it is impossible to collect them all into the same workhouse. We can seldom see more, at one time, than those employed in one single branch. Though in such manufactures, therefore, the work may really be divided into a much greater number of parts than in those of a more trifling nature, the division is not near so obvious, and has accordingly been much less observed. THE DIVISION OF LABOUR 5 To take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufacture; but one in which the division of labour has been very often taken notice of, the trade of the pin-maker; a workman not educated to this business (which the division of labour has rendered a distinct trade), nor acquainted with the use of the machinery employed in it (to the invention of which the same division of labour has probably given occasion), could scarce, perhaps, with his utmost industry, make one pin in a day, and certainly could not make twenty. But in the way in which this business is now carried on, not only the whole work is a peculiar trade, but it is divided into a number of branches, of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. One man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a peculiar business, to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them. I have seen a small manufactory of this kind where ten men only were employed, and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations. But though they were very poor, and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when they exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day. There are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of fortyeight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as nan making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two hundred and fortieth, perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth part of what they are at present capable of performing, in consequence of a proper division and combination of their different operations. In every other art and manufacture, the effects of the division of labour are similar to what they are in this very trifling one; though, in many of them, the labour can neither be so much\n",
      "\n",
      "THE WEALTH OF NATIONS 6 subdivided, nor reduced to so great a simplicity of operation. The division of labour, however, so far as it can be introduced, occasions, in every art, a proportionable increase of the productive powers of labour. The separation of different trades and employments from one another seems to have taken place in consequence of this advantage. This separation, too, is generally carried furthest in those countries which enjoy the highest degree of industry and improvement; what is the work of one man in a rude state of society being generally that of several in an improved one. In every improved society, the farmer is generally nothing but a farmer; the manufacturer, nothing but a manufacturer. The labour, too, which is necessary to produce any one complete manufacture is almost always divided among a great number of hands. How many different trades are employed in each branch of the linen and woollen manufactures from the growers of the flax and the wool, to the bleachers and smoothers of the linen, or to the dyers and dressers of the cloth! The nature of agriculture, indeed, does not admit of so many subdivisions of labour, nor of so complete a separation of one business from another, as manufactures. It is impossible to separate so entirely the business of the grazier from that of the corn-farmer as the trade of the carpenter is commonly separated from that of the smith. The spinner is almost always a distinct person from the weaver; but the ploughman, the harrower, the sower of the seed, and the reaper of the corn, are often the same. The occasions for those different sorts of labour returning with the different seasons of the year, it is impossible that one man should be constantly employed in any one of them. This impossibility of making so complete and entire a separation of all the different branches of labour employed in agriculture is perhaps the reason why the improvement of the productive powers of labour in this art does not always keep pace with their improvement in manufactures. The most opulent nations, indeed, generally excel all their neighbours in agriculture as well as in manufactures; but they are commonly more distinguished by their superiority in the latter than in the former. Their lands are in general better cultivated, and having more labour and expense bestowed upon them, produce more in proportion to the extent and natural fertility of the ground. But this superiority of produce is seldom much more than in proportion to the superiority of labour and expense. In agriculture, the labour of the rich country is not always much more productive than that of the poor; or, at least, it is never so much THE DIVISION OF LABOUR 7 more productive as it commonly is in manufactures. The corn of the rich country, therefore, will not always, in the same degree of goodness, come cheaper to market than that of the poor. The corn of Poland, in the same degree of goodness, is as cheap as that of France, notwithstanding the superior opulence and improvement of the latter country. The corn of France is, in the corn provinces, fully as good, and in most years nearly about the same price with the corn of England, though, in opulence and improvement, France is perhaps inferior to England. The corn-lands of England, however, are better cultivated than those of France, and the cornlands of France are said to be much better cultivated than those of Poland. But though the poor country, notwithstanding the inferiority of its cultivation, can, in some measure, rival the rich in the cheapness and goodness of its corn, it can pretend to no such competition in its manufactures; at least if those manufactures suit the soil, climate, and situation of the rich country. The silks of France are better and cheaper than those of England, because the silk manufacture, at least under the present high duties upon the importation of raw silk, does not so well suit the climate of England as that of France. But the hardware and the coarse woollens of England are beyond all comparison superior to those of France, and much cheaper too in the same degree of goodness. In Poland there are said to be scarce any manufactures of any kind, a few of those coarser household manufactures excepted, without which no country can well subsist. This great increase of the quantity of work which, in consequence of the division of labour, the same number of people are capable of performing, is owing to three different circumstances; first, to the increase of dexterity in every particular workman; secondly, to the saving of the time which is commonly lost in nan passing from one species of work to another; and lastly, to the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labour, and enable one man to do the work of many. First, the improvement of the dexterity of the workman necessarily increases the quantity of the work he can perform; and the division of labour, by reducing every man's business to some one simple operation, and by making this operation the sole employment of his life, necessarily increases very much the dexterity of the workman. A common smith, who, though accustomed to handle the hammer, has never been used to make nails, if upon some particular occasion he is obliged to attempt it, will scarce, I\n",
      "\n",
      "THE WEALTH OF NATIONS 8 am assured, be able to make above two or three hundred nails in a day, and those too very bad ones. A smith who has been accustomed to make nails, but whose sole or principal business has not been that of a nailer, can seldom with his utmost diligence make more than eight hundred or a thousand nails in a day. I have seen several boys under twenty years of age who had never exercised any other trade but that of making nails, and who, when they exerted themselves, could make, each of them, upwards of two thousand three hundred nails in a day. The making of a nail, however, is by no means one of the simplest operations. The same person blows the bellows, stirs or mends the fire as there is occasion, heats the iron, and forges every part of the nail: in forging the head too he is obliged to change his tools. The different operations into which the making of a pin, or of a metal button, is subdivided, are all of them much more simple, and the dexterity of the person, of whose life it has been the sole business to perform them, is usually much greater. The rapidity with which some of the operations of those manufactures are performed, exceeds what the human hand could, by those who had never seen them, be supposed capable of acquiring. Secondly, the advantage which is gained by saving the time commonly lost in passing from one sort of work to another is much greater than we should at first view be apt to imagine it. It is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools. A country weaver, who cultivates a small farm, must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field, and from the field to his loom. When the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse, the loss of time is no doubt much less. It is even in this case, however, very considerable. A man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another. When he first begins the new work he is seldom very keen and hearty; his mind, as they say, does not go to it, and for some time he rather trifles than applies to good purpose. The habit of sauntering and of indolent careless application, which is naturally, or rather necessarily acquired by every country workman who is obliged to change his work and his tools every half hour, and to apply his hand in twenty different ways almost every day of his life, renders him almost always slothful and lazy, and incapable of any vigorous application even on the most pressing occasions. Independent, therefore, of his deficiency in point of dexterity, this THE DIVISION OF LABOUR 9 cause alone must always reduce considerably the quantity of work which he is capable of performing. Thirdly, and lastly, everybody must be sensible how much labour is facilitated and abridged by the application of proper machinery. It is unnecessary to give any example. I shall only observe, therefore, that the invention of all those machines by which labour is so much facilitated and abridged seems to have been originally owing to the division of labour. Men are much more likely to discover easier and readier methods of attaining any object when the whole attention of their minds is directed towards that single object than when it is dissipated among a great variety of things. But in consequence of the division of labour, the whole of every man's attention comes naturally to be directed towards some one very simple object. It is naturally to be expected, therefore, that some one or other of those who are employed in each particular branch of labour should soon find out easier and readier methods of performing their own particular work, wherever the nature of it admits of such improvement. A great part of the machines made use of in those manufactures in which labour is most subdivided, were originally the inventions of common workmen, who, being each of them employed in some very simple operation, naturally turned their thoughts towards finding out easier and readier methods of performing it. Whoever has been much accustomed to visit such manufactures must frequently have been shown very pretty machines, which were the inventions of such workmen in order to facilitate and quicken their own particular part of the work.

One of the greatest improvements that has been made upon this machine, since it was first invented, was in this manner the discovery of a boy who wanted to save his own labour.

But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two hundred and fortieth, perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth, part of what they are at present capable of performing, in consequence of a proper division and combination of their different operations.\n",

      "In every other art and manufacture, the effects of the division of labour are similar to what they are in this very trifling one, though, in many of them, the labour can neither be so much subdivided, nor reduced to so great a simplicity of operation. The division of labour, however, so far as it can be introduced, occasions, in every art, a proportionable increase of the productive powers of labour. The separation of different trades and employments from one another, seems to have taken place in consequence of this advantage. This separation, too, is generally carried furthest in those countries which enjoy the highest degree of industry and improvement; what is the work of one man, in a rude state of society, being generally that of several in an improved one. In every improved society, the farmer is generally nothing but a farmer; the manufacturer, nothing but a manufacturer. The labour, too, which is necessary to produce any one complete manufacture, is almost always divided among a great number of hands. How many different trades are employed in each branch of the linen and woollen manufactures, from the growers of the flax and the wool, to the bleachers and smoothers of the linen, or to the dyers and dressers of the cloth! The nature of agriculture, indeed, does not admit of so many subdivisions of labour, nor of so complete a separation of one business from another, as manufactures. It is impossible to separate so entirely the business of the grazier from that of the corn-farmer, as the trade of the carpenter is commonly separated from that of the smith. The spinner is almost always a distinct person from the weaver; but the ploughman, the harrower, the sower of the seed, and the reaper of the corn, are often the same. The occasions for those different sorts of labour returning with the different seasons of the year, it is impossible that one man should be constantly employed in any one of them. This impossibility of making so complete and entire a separation of all the different branches of labour employed in agriculture, is perhaps the reason why the improvement of the productive powers of labour, in this art, does not always keep pace with their improvement in manufactures. The most opulent nations, indeed, generally excel all their neighbours in agriculture as well as in manufactures; but they are commonly more distinguished by their superiority in the latter than in the former. Their lands are in general better cultivated, and having more labour and expense bestowed upon them, produce more in proportion to the extent and natural fertility of the ground. But this superiority of produce is seldom much more than in proportion to the superiority of labour and expense. In agriculture, the labour of the rich country is not always much more productive than that of the poor; or, at least, it is never so much more productive, as it commonly is in manufactures. The corn of the rich country, therefore, will not always, in the same degree of goodness, come cheaper to market than that of the poor. The corn of Poland, in the same degree of goodness, is as cheap as that of France, notwithstanding the superior opulence and improvement of the latter country. The corn of France is, in the corn-provinces, fully as good, and in most years nearly about the same price with the corn of England, though, in opulence and improvement, France is perhaps inferior to England. The corn-lands of England, however, are better cultivated than those of France, and the corn-lands of France are said to be much better cultivated than those of Poland. But though the poor country, notwithstanding the inferiority of its cultivation, can, in some measure, rival the rich in the cheapness and goodness of its corn, it can pretend to no such competition in its manufactures, at least if those manufactures suit the soil, climate, and situation, of the rich country. The silks of France are better and cheaper than those of England, because the silk manufacture, at least under the present high duties upon the importation of raw silk, does not so well suit the climate of England as that of France. But the hardware and the coarse woollens of England are beyond all comparison superior to those of France, and much cheaper, too, in the same degree of goodness. In Poland there are said to be scarce any manufactures of any kind, a few of those coarser household manufactures excepted, without which no country can well subsist.\n",

      "This great increase in the quantity of work, which, in consequence of the division of labour, the same number of people are capable of performing, is owing to three different circumstances; first, to the increase of dexterity in every particular workman; secondly, to the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another; and, lastly, to the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labour, and enable one man to do the work of many.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the improvement of the dexterity of the workmen, necessarily increases the quantity of the work he can perform; and the division of labour, by reducing every man’s business to some one simple operation, and by making this operation the sole employment of his life, necessarily increases very much the dexterity of the workman. A common smith, who, though accustomed to handle the hammer, has never been used to make nails, if, upon some particular occasion, he is obliged to attempt it, will scarce, I am assured, be able to make above two or three hundred nails in a day, and those, too, very bad ones. A smith who has been accustomed to make nails, but whose sole or principal business has not been that of a nailer, can seldom, with his utmost diligence, make more than eight hundred or a thousand nails in a day. I have seen several boys, under twenty years of age, who had never exercised any other trade but that of making nails, and who, when they exerted themselves, could make, each of them, upwards of two thousand three hundred nails in a day. The making of a nail, however, is by no means one of the simplest operations. The same person blows the bellows, stirs or mends the fire as there is occasion, heats the iron, and forges every part of the nail: in forging the head, too, he is obliged to change his tools. The different operations into which the making of a pin, or of a metal button, is subdivided, are all of them much more simple, and the dexterity of the person, of whose life it has been the sole business to perform them, is usually much greater. The rapidity with which some of the operations of those manufactures are performed, exceeds what the human hand could, by those who had never seen them, be supposed capable of acquiring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the advantage which is gained by saving the time commonly lost in passing from one sort of work to another, is much greater than we should at first view be apt to imagine it. It is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another, that is carried on in a different place, and with quite different tools. A country weaver, who cultivates a small farm, must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field, and from the field to his loom. When the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse, the loss of time is, no doubt, much less. It is, even in this case, however, very considerable. A man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another. When he first begins the new work, he is seldom very keen and hearty; his mind, as they say, does not go to it, and for some time he rather trifles than applies to good purpose. The habit of sauntering, and of indolent careless application, which is naturally, or rather necessarily, acquired by every country workman who is obliged to change his work and his tools every half hour, and to apply his hand in twenty different ways almost every day of his life, renders him almost always slothful and lazy, and incapable of any vigorous application, even on the most pressing occasions. Independent, therefore, of his deficiency in point of dexterity, this cause alone must always reduce considerably the quantity of work which he is capable of performing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, and lastly, everybody must be sensible how much labour is facilitated and abridged by the application of proper machinery. It is unnecessary to give any example. I shall only observe, therefore, that the invention of all those machines by which labour is so much facilitated and abridged, seems to have been originally owing to the division of labour. Men are much more likely to discover easier and readier methods of attaining any object, when the whole attention of their minds is directed towards that single object, than when it is dissipated among a great variety of things. But, in consequence of the division of labour, the whole of every man’s attention comes naturally to be directed towards some one very simple object. It is naturally to be expected, therefore, that some one or other of those who are employed in each particular branch of labour should soon find out easier and readier methods of performing their own particular work, whenever the nature of it admits of such improvement. A great part of the machines made use of in those manufactures in which labour is most subdivided, were originally the invention of common workmen, who, being each of them employed in some very simple operation, naturally turned their thoughts towards finding out easier and readier methods of performing it. Whoever has been much accustomed to visit such manufactures, must frequently have been shewn very pretty machines, which were the inventions of such workmen, in order to facilitate and quicken their own particular part of the work. In the first fire engines {this was the current designation for steam engines}, a boy was constantly employed to open and shut alternately the communication between the boiler and the cylinder, according as the piston either ascended or descended. One of those boys, who loved to play with his companions, observed that, by tying a string from the handle of the valve which opened this communication to another part of the machine, the valve would open and shut without his assistance, and leave him at liberty to divert himself with his play-fellows. One of the greatest improvements that has been made upon this machine, since it was first invented, was in this manner the discovery of a boy who wanted to save his own labour.\n",

      "THE greatest improvement in the productive powers of labour, and the greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which it is anywhere directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labour. The effects of the division of labour, in the general business of society, will be more easily understood by considering in what manner it operates in some particular manufactures. It is commonly supposed to be carried furthest in some very trifling ones; not perhaps that it really is carried further in them than in others of more importance: but in those trifling manufactures which are destined to supply the small wants of but a small number of people, the whole number of workmen must necessarily be small; and those employed in every different branch of the work can often be collected into the same workhouse, and placed at once under the view of the spectator. In those great manufactures, on the contrary, which are destined to supply the great wants of the great body of the people, every different branch of the work employs so great a number of workmen that it is impossible to collect them all into the same workhouse. We can seldom see more, at one time, than those employed in one single branch. Though in such manufactures, therefore, the work may really be divided into a much greater number of parts than in those of a more trifling nature, the division is not near so obvious, and has accordingly been much less observed. THE DIVISION OF LABOUR 5 To take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufacture; but one in which the division of labour has been very often taken notice of, the trade of the pin-maker; a workman not educated to this business (which the division of labour has rendered a distinct trade), nor acquainted with the use of the machinery employed in it (to the invention of which the same division of labour has probably given occasion), could scarce, perhaps, with his utmost industry, make one pin in a day, and certainly could not make twenty. But in the way in which this business is now carried on, not only the whole work is a peculiar trade, but it is divided into a number of branches, of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. One man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a peculiar business, to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them. I have seen a small manufactory of this kind where ten men only were employed, and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations. But though they were very poor, and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when they exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day. There are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of fortyeight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as nan making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two hundred and fortieth, perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth part of what they are at present capable of performing, in consequence of a proper division and combination of their different operations.
